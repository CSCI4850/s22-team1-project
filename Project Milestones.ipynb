Due to losing a team member and some issues with loading our large amounts of data, we have made plans to scale back how much data we will be using and how specific the animal identifiers will be. Rather than focusing on breeds, the breed categories will be combined into general similar categories to better match with the limited number of human compatibility traits we can distinguish. We also had issues with licensing a dataset, so major changes have been made to the data we will be using for the human identification portion of the project. This new dataset is almost complete."
